**How Should You Take Care of Your Fine Jewelry?**

When you buy fine jewelry, you want it to last a lifetime, and rightly so. So, here are a few pointers on how to look after your fine jewels:

**1.	When in doubt, take it off.**

Quality jewelry, particularly engagement and wedding rings, is made to be worn every day. Moissanite, for example, has a hardness rating of 9.25 on the MOHs scale, indicating that it is resistant to scratching and everyday wear and tear. On the other hand, the hardest stone on the planet, diamond, is rated a ten on the MOHs hardness scale. Few gemstones, such as emeralds and sapphires, are more prone to destruction than others, and some metals are harder than others.
Some malleable metals, like harder gemstones, are more likely to maintain corrosion from everyday use. Remove the gold rings or bracelets when engaging in manual labor tasks, such as DIY home ventures or working out, to prevent bruises or dents. Leave your fine jewels at home if you intend on enjoying a nice day by the beach.

**2.	Properly clean your fine jewelry once per year.**

Having your fine jewelry like unique moissanite engagement rings professionally polished at least once a year will help prolong the life of your piece and keep the shine as bright as the day you purchased it. In addition, you should go for at least two professional cleaning visits a year if you wear your jewel daily, such as moissanite halo engagement rings. 

**3.	Use the proper jewelry cleaner for the metal and gemstone you're working with.**

Know what stones and metals you're working with while you're washing your fine jewelry at home. You should never use harsh chemicals to clean delicate jewelry because they can cause corrosion to the settings. 
Instead, soak most fine jewelry in a tub of warm water with dishwashing soap to clean it. Scrub gently with a soft toothbrush, then air dry. Finally, scrub the pearls with a smooth makeup brush.
When you use a quality cleaning solution to clean your fine jewelry at home, make sure you know what kind of metal your ring is built of, whether it's silver, gold, or platinum. Since each metal is different, it can respond accordingly to other cleaning materials. Take your [moissanite halo engagement rings](https://diamondrensu.com/collections/engagement-rings/products/14k-gold-cushion-halo-split-shank-moissanite-diamond-engagement-ring) to a skilled jeweler if you're uncertain about the metal kind.

**4.	Storage is crucial.**

The way you store your fine jewelry will help you have items that are as stunning as the day you purchased them for a long time. 
Since hard stones like moissanite and diamond will destroy other jewelry pieces, don't have all of your jewelry in one location. Instead, keep your fine jewelry in a compartmentalized case or cabinet with a fabric lining. 

**5.	Obtain insurance for it.**

Getting insurance for your fine jewels like unique moissanite engagement rings will help you avoid the stress of missing your prized possessions. This is also available as an add-on to the homeowner's policy, or some companies specialize in fine jewelry insurance.
